###Assignment 1 : Generate  & plot 100 samples of 6 different distributions
Chosen distribution: Normal, Binomial, Poisson, Chi-square, Rayleigh, Gamma
Assumptions:
-100 samples from range(10,2000) with no repeated values
-P=0.5 for binomial distribution
-sd=10 for normal distribution
-mean=100 for all distributions

Observation:
-the higher the samples amount, the nearer to population mean

###Assignment 2 : Reproduce result from Prison Report with z-score test and chi-square test
Assumptions:
-alpha=0.05

Observation: the reproduction matches with the original report data.
