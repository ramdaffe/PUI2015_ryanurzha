Comment:

While at the first glance the plot looks clear and easy to read, there are a couple of points that can be improved. First of all, the usage of 1:1 ratio line implied that the author frame this with an equal income narrative, but this makes another insight difficult to ascertain: how much is the deviation of income share of each gender per race compared to national average. However, this presentation is already packing good density of information and clearly labeled. The selection of contrasting color is sufficient, while the use of star as differentating shape, while seems unnecessary, doesn't add more clutter due to small amount of data point. There is a lack of contextual information (e.g. year, sample size, source) that may confuse the audience, but it is expected that this graph will be presented along with necessary explanation. There is no misleading element that may distort the data. Overall, this plot is a good one.
