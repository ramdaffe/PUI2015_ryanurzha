Plot:

Comment:

The plot sure is a pretty one, but there are a couple of misrepresentation that detracts from the overall honesty of the data. First of all, there is no indication that this is a logarithmic plot (although it's stated on the code). Second, the intended absence of any tick marks or grid makes it difficult to identify the edges of each clusters, especially the outliers. Third, the marker size is too small that there are several scattered ones that are hard to identify by colors. That being said, the color choice is appealing and the clusters can be identified. A faint trend line, if added, will also help in presenting the data although not completely necessary.
